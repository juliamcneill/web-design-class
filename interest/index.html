        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>My name is Julia McNeill, and I'm at junior at New York University, studying Art History, Marketing, and Web Development. I've been passionate about the genre of LGBT Film for over five years, and want to share that love with others. I've watched each of the films on this website myself; however, the ratings shown are average critic and fan ratings. I created this website as part of my Introduction to Web Design class! You can find my Letterboxd account <a href="https://letterboxd.com/jmacny/">here</a>.</p>

Groups from each house compete in elaborate balls that take cues from the world of fashion. Also touching on issues of racism and poverty, the film features interviews with a number of renowned drag queens, including Willi Ninja, Pepper LaBeija and Dorian Corey.</td>
