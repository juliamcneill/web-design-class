        <h3>The Introduction</h3>
        <p>The destruction of the city of Palmyra, a UNESCO world heritage site, is only a fraction of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant’s ongoing campaign against archaeology and iconography in the Middle East. Because the Syrian Civil War has left hundreds of thousands dead and many more without homes, the irreparable damage to the art and architecture in the region has often been deprioritized; the fate of the Lion of Allāt in the city of Palmyra, Syria is just one example of this damage. In a region overflowing with globally-relevant cultural history, it is increasingly important to install additional measures of protection for or relocate archaeological objects, especially in times of war and invasion (Curry).</p>

        <h3>The Statue</h3>
        <p>The Lion of Allāt is an Ancient Near Eastern statue that adorned the Temple of Allāt in Palmyra, Syria. The immense figure is over ten feet tall, weighs fifteen tons, and is made of a limestone found in the region (“Isis Militants Destroy 2,000-Year-Old Statue of Lion at Palmyra”). The sculpture depicts a deterrent lion protecting a peaceful antelope between its legs. The lion is depicted in frontal, adding to its powerful and intimidating appearance, while the antelope lays in calm submission. An inscription on the left leg of the lion reads: “Allāt will bless whoever will not shed blood in the sanctuary,” Allāt being a name used to refer to multiple goddesses of the ancient Near East who are often accompanied by depictions of lions (Drijvers 65). The Lion of Allāt statue was described by Maamoun Abdelkarim, director of Syria’s antiquities, as an irreplaceable piece of history and art (“Isis Militants Destroy 2,000-Year-Old Statue of Lion at Palmyra”).</p>

          <h3>The History</h3>
          <p>As part of the Roman Empire, Palmyra was once a bustling cultural and trade center of the ancient world (Katz). The Lion of Allāt was created in Palmyra more than 2,000 years ago.
            <button type="button" class="btn btn-default" data-container="body" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="right" data-content="The use of limestone, the style of the depiction of the animals, and the language of the inscription all help to pinpoint the date of the lion back to the first century BC.">
            How do we know this?
            </button>
          The statue was thought to have been part of an orthostat, or a large slab-like stone that stands upwards and is often carved into reliefs. This particular orthostat would have been originally placed against the enclosure wall of Allāt’s sanctuary in Palmyra (Drijvers 65-66).</p>
          <p>The temple that the lion was created to ornament was devoted to the goddess Allāt, who which the inscription refers to (Katz). The statue may have been placed at the entrance of the temple and used to represent inviolability and asylum, signifying safety and shelter for those fleeing from turmoil. The temple’s location at the edge of the city meant that it was used by both semi-nomads and the settled population in this regard. In this way, the statue and temple helped to neutralize many bloody social conflicts, and the safety of the gazelle between the lion’s legs may be a symbolic representation of the social convenience of a sanctuary that guarantees safety for individuals in danger (Drijvers 69-71). The provenance of the piece before the 20th century has not been well-documented; however, we do know that sometime later in antiquity, the sculpture was reused in a foundation erected in the template courtyard, damaging it (Markowski 470).</p>
          <p>Although European merchants visited Palmyra as early as the 17th century, archaeological excavations below the ground didn’t begin until 1946, when Syria won its independence from the French government. These excavations unearthed marketplaces, forums, and temples, but above all, artwork that revealed a thriving multilingual and polytheistic society (Farago).</p>
          <p class="lead">The Lion of Allāt was uncovered in 1977 by a Polish archaeological mission directed by Professor M. Gawlikowski (Markowski 470). It was discovered in the Temple of Allāt, in the Western quarter of Palmyra; however it was in broken into pieces (Drijvers 65). The archaeologists decided to remount the fragments in front of the entrance to the site museum as a statue in the round (Markowski 470-473). Throughout the 20th century, Palmyra remained one of Syria’s most popular tourist destinations, with the lion becoming a symbol of the city (Curry). Abdelkarim asserts that every tourist visiting the city took a photo with it (Katz).</p>
          <p>After twenty-five years, problems with the structure of the piece became apparent. The lion had originally been constructed on an angle, and considerable cracking and disconnection of fragments resulted from the statue’s shaken equilibrium. Restoration of the statue began in 2005, to both ensure proper balance and recreate the original form of the lion as a high relief, giving visitors a more realistic idea of what the original lion’s presence would have felt like in situ (Markowski 470-473).</p>
          <p>After the onset of the Syrian Civil War in 2011, the statue was covered with a metal plate and sandbags to protect it from fighting. Unfortunately, the people of Palmyra did not foresee that these measures wouldn’t be sufficient protection (“Isis Militants Destroy 2,000-Year-Old Statue of Lion at Palmyra”).</p>

          <h3>The Destruction</h3>
          <p>This absence of further protection or relocation of the Lion of Allāt proved to be an unfortunate lack of foresight. Prior to the damage of the lion, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant had already destroyed countless antiquities and heritage sites under its vast control throughout Syria and Iraq (“Isis Militants Destroy 2,000-Year-Old Statue of Lion at Palmyra”). ISIS continues to claim that this destruction was and is religiously motivated, as under the group’s radical Sunni interpretation of Islam, statues and figural depictions are idolatrous (“Isis Militants Destroy 2,000-Year-Old Statue of Lion at Palmyra”). The destruction of art by ISIS is often filmed and released publicly as a form of propaganda for the development of both their recruitment and reputation. Paradoxically, the group has also used the looting and sale of antiquities to finance their operations, suggesting that perhaps their motivation to destroy all symbols is adulterated. As Columbia University historian Christopher Jones states, the relationship between ISIS and the destruction of cultural heritage is “both propagandistic and sincere” (Curry).</p>
	        <p>On May 21st of 2015, ISIS captured Palmyra from Syrian government forces. Some artwork was saved: for example, most of the pieces in the city’s museum were evacuated by staff before members of ISIS arrived (“Isis Militants Destroy 2,000-Year-Old Statue of Lion at Palmyra”). However, many pieces could not be or were not taken, and hundreds of ISIS fighters proceeded to ransack the city. Although they originally promised to leave the site’s columns and temples untouched, these promises soon proved empty (Curry).</p>
	        <p>In an attempt to both terrorize the city and cleanse it of idolatry, ISIS fighters destroyed the Temple of Bel, the Temple of Baalshamin, and the Arch of Triumph, may of which were prime, valuable examples of the fusing of Roman and Syrian styles (Katz). They used bulldozers, explosives, pickaxes, and sledgehammers, and recorded videos of the destruction which were then released to the public. Horrifically, the group also beheaded the archaeologist Khaled al-Assad, the leading authority on Palmyra’s history. They broadcast his death online, hanging his lifeless body from a column (Curry). Several other captives were tied to ancient columns and executed with explosives (Farago). As Farago of the New York Times says, these were “crimes against the present and the past at once”.</p>
	        <p>As part of the damage done to Palmyra, the Islamic State badly damaged the Lion of Allāt. Abdelkarim stated that this crime was the worst that ISIS has committed against Palmyra’s heritage, due to the of the significance, beauty, and popularity of the piece (“Isis Militants Destroy 2,000-Year-Old Statue of Lion at Palmyra”).</p>

        <h3>The Restoration</h3>
        <p>	In March of 2016, when Syrian forces temporarily recaptured Palmyra, the lion statue was found among a scene of “beheaded busts, smashed sarcophagi, and statues” (Voon). UNESCO sent a Rapid Assessment Mission to Palmyra from on April 24th of 2016, supported through its Heritage Emergency Fund (“Restoration Completed on Lion of Al-Lāt Statue from Ancient City of Palmyra, Damaged by ISIL”). The lion was quickly moved to Damascus for its restoration and safety (Katz).</p>
	      <p>The restoration of the lion was carried out by the Directorate-General of Antiquities and Museums, led by Mahmoud Hammoud, in cooperation with Polish experts and archaeologists and UNESCO’s Emergency Safeguarding of the Syrian Cultural Heritage project, a European Union-funded initiative that seeks to monitor, document, and safeguard Syria’s cultural heritage. About half of the resulting sculpture is original; however the original and reconstructed parts of the sculpture fit seamlessly together due to the use of a similar limestone material and a precise reconstruction technique (Voon).</p>
	      <p>After reconstruction, the lion was situated in the garden of the National Museum of Damascus. It is an eyewitness to and example of Syria’s deep-rooted ancient history and steadfastness against invasion and destruction by their adversaries. The Museum hosted a special event in order to celebrate the effort to protect Syrian ruins and heritage from war, and the reconstructed lion was showcased at this event (Raslan). Hamed Al Hammami, Director of the UNESCO Regional Bureau for Education in the Arab States and UNESCO Representative to Lebanon and the Syrian Arab Republic, stated that the lion “is part of a broader project to protect the unique cultural heritage of Syria, which unfortunately remains at risk” (“Restoration Completed on Lion of Al-Lāt Statue from Ancient City of Palmyra, Damaged by ISIL”). Hammoud believes that the statue may one day return to stand and watch over Palmyra (Katz). However, for now, it remains in Damascus as a symbol of hope for the recapture and restoration of Middle Eastern art that is currently stolen, looted, or damaged as a result of war and other turmoil.</p>

        <h3>The Conclusion</h3>
        <p>For now, the task of protecting Syria’s cultural heritage is shared by both Syrian departments and external governments. Not only does the UNESCO project work to protect, safeguard, and restore Syria’s heritage; it also works to “monitor and document Syrian cultural heritage, develop capacity amongst Syrian experts and institutions, and mitigate the destruction and loss of Syrian cultural heritage through national and international awareness raising efforts” (“Restoration Completed on Lion of Al-Lāt Statue from Ancient City of Palmyra, Damaged by ISIL”). Although it may seem diplomatic to shift priorities away from the protection of cultural heritage while war is raging and lives are in danger, there are still many archaeologists, government leaders, and and journalists who refuse to succumb and are continuously working to “move antiquities out of harm’s way, support buildings in distress, and document the damage in the hope of doing something about it later on” (Harkin). The Lion of Allāt is just one example of the exemplary successes that these individuals are achieving.</p>
